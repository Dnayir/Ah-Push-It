    <h1 class="heading">Naomi and Diren</h1>
    <p>Two households, both alike in dignity
        (In fair Verona, where we lay our scene),
        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
        Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
        A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;
        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
        Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
        The fearful passage of their death-marked love
        And the continuance of their parents’ rage,
        Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove,
        Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;.</p>
